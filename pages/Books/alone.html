        quality time alone in the presence of God,<br />
        in sincere, heartfelt prayers. Most of life's problems are solved by
        being alone with God. <br />

        meditate, to pray and connect <br />

        Someone once said that when a man <br />
        works, man works, But when a man prays, God works. Spending time alone

        isn't it? <br />

        according to Matthew 11:12 NLT.
